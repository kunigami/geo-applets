GeoApplets
==========

Computational Geometry Applets.

This is an old project I've started in 2008 which I decided to make available and make it easier to build (using Maven). 
More info about the project can be found in my personal page: http://www.kuniga.me/projects/geometry/

## Installing

You can compile all the applets running the following Maven comand (at the root of the project):

`mvn clean package`

## Usage

One way to try the applets is using `appletviewer` application:

`appletviewer target/classes/index.php`
